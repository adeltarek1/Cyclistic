This phase will be done by presentation. I used excel for my visualizations.

### Act:

- Offer a weekend-only membership at a different price point than the full annual membership.

- Coupons and discounts could be handed out along with the annual subscription / weekend-only membership for the usage of electric bikes targeting casual riders. Also increasing the number of electric bike while reducing classic bikes if electric bike costs more for the pass, this can be beneficial for the company. (As electric bike are already in trend and usage is good as per member and ride type data.

- Create marketing campaigns which can be sent via email, or advertisement in the docking stations explaining why annual member is beneficial. Campaigns should be placed at the peak months of the year.
